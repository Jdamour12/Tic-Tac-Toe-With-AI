This is a game called Tic Tac Toe programmed in python.

There is only two choices for the user who need to play, there is single-player mode and multiple-players mode. 
Once you choose multiple-players mode, you need other person to play with; however in single-player mode you will be playing with machine. 

In single-player mode, I have used AI algolithm called minmax algolithm and that algorithm is the one which will enable a user to play with
machine.

Enjoy!
